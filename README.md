## ⏳ Pomodoro Timer – Productivity App using Python & Tkinter
# 📌 Overview
This project is a Pomodoro Timer built using Python’s Tkinter library. It helps improve focus and productivity by implementing the Pomodoro Technique — a time management method based on 25-minute focused work sessions followed by short breaks.

The timer visually guides the user through work sessions, short breaks, and a long break after 4 cycles.

# 🍅 What is the Pomodoro Technique?
